# What is this?
- This is an updated version (from python2 to python3) of the [Berkeley Pacman](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html) project. Its nearly 1-to-1 so you should be able to follow along with their general ideas.

# How do I get this code to run?

All the setup instructions inside [documentation/setup.md](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/berkeley_pacman/blob/master/documentation/setup.md)

<br>

# What are the important files?

- `main/` contains all the code, however you can ignore many of the python files
- `main/search.py` is where all your search algorithms should be.
- `main/searchAgents.py` is where all of your agents should be.

<br>

# What commands are there?

As soon as you run the start command (from the auto setup in `documentation/setup.md`), it will list all the project commands. But here's a quick overview anyways.
- `run pacman`
- `run autograder`
- `project pacman_examples`

Many of these commands are simple wrappers like `cd ./main;python pacman.py`. You're free to run the python directly if desired.
